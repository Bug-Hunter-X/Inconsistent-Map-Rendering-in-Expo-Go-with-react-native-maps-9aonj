This bug occurs when using the Expo Go app to test an application that uses the react-native-maps library.  The map fails to render correctly, often appearing blank or displaying a distorted view. This issue is inconsistent and doesn't always reproduce, making debugging challenging. It's particularly frustrating because it works fine on other devices or emulators. The error messages in the console, if any, are typically unhelpful.
