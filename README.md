# Inconsistent Map Rendering in Expo Go with react-native-maps

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using the `react-native-maps` library within an Expo managed workflow. The map view renders inconsistently in Expo Go, sometimes appearing blank or distorted. This issue is intermittent and device-specific, making it difficult to pinpoint the root cause.

## Bug Description

The primary issue is the inconsistent rendering of the map within the Expo Go application. On certain devices, the map renders correctly, while on others, it's either completely blank or displays a distorted view.  There are no clear error messages in the console to assist in debugging.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Start the Expo development server using `expo start`.
4. Open the app in Expo Go on different devices.
5. Observe the inconsistent map rendering behavior.

## Potential Causes

* **Expo Go limitations:** Expo Go might have compatibility issues with specific versions of `react-native-maps` or underlying map providers.
* **Device-specific issues:** The bug might be related to discrepancies in device hardware or software configurations.
* **Asynchronous loading:** Issues with how map resources are loaded asynchronously could contribute to rendering problems.

## Solution

The solution involved using a different Map provider and loading it in a slightly different way.  Check `bugSolution.js` for the updated code that correctly renders the map across different devices and Expo Go versions.
